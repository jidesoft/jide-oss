/**
 * DelegateAction is a special AbstractAction which can do something then delegate to another action depending on the
 * return value of {@link #delegateActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent)}. There are two usages of it. First, you
 * can use {@link #replaceAction(javax.swing.JComponent, int, javax.swing.KeyStroke, DelegateAction)} to replace the action
 * associated with the specified keystroke with the DelegateAction. The DelegateAction will be triggered when the
 * keystroke is pressed. After DelegateAction is done, it can return true or false. If false, the original action
 * associated with the keystroke will be triggered as well. This solves the problem that {@link
 * JComponent#registerKeyboardAction(java.awt.event.ActionListener, String, javax.swing.KeyStroke, int)} will replace the
 * original action so that the original action will never be triggered.
 * <p/>
 * The second way to use DelegateAction is to delegate the action from one component to another component using {@link
 * #replaceAction(javax.swing.JComponent, int, javax.swing.JComponent, int, javax.swing.KeyStroke, DelegateAction)}. In this
 * case, the keystroke on the first component parameter will be triggered the DelegateAction. If DelegateAction returns
 * false, the registered action on the second component parameter will be triggered. If you pass in {@link
 * PassthroughDelegateAction}, the registered action on the second component will always be triggered.
 * <p/>
 * Please notes, if you call replaceAction several times on the same component with the same keystroke, it will form a
 * chain of DelegateActions. In this case, the first call will be the first DelegateAction. In the other words, the
 * first one will have the highest priority and will be triggered first. Ideally, we should assign a priority to each
 * DelegateAction. But for the sake of simplicity, we decided not doing it for now. So because of this, this class is
 * not ready to be used as public API. We have to make it public because different packages in JIDE need to use it. If
 * you want to use, please use it with caution. We don't guarantee that we will not change the public methods on this
 * classes.
 * <p/>
