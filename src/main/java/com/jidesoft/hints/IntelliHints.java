 * <code>IntelliHints</code> is an interface that defines all necessary methods to implement showing a hint popup
 * depending on a context and allows user to pick from a list of hints. {@link #createHintsComponent()} will create a
 * component that contains the hints. It will be shown in a popup window. After hint popup is created, {@link
 * #updateHints(Object, boolean)} will update the content of hints based on the context. Once user picks a hint from the hint
 * popup, {@link #getSelectedHint()} will be called to find the hint that user selected and call {@link
 * #acceptHint(Object)} to accept it.
